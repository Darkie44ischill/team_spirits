# team_spirits

#Things done
 1. Conceptualization of game.
 2. Enemy pathfinding gd script mechanisms

#Things working on
 1. attack mechanism
 2. dodge/evade mechanism
 3. swipe gestures
    


A spirit based enagaging indie game with a plot (atleast it was supposed to be)

final update:-
1.added a working pathfinding logic with the enemies having two states-idle & chase
2.all the map was self made
3.added a dash ability
4.added collectible hearts

tried to do that but failed miserably :c
1. an attack mechanism, worked out the attack mechanism with self made sprites but couldnt kill the enemies
2. sound effects ran out of time
